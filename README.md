Xposed module to disable "This App won't run unless you Enable/Update Google Play Services" popups

I use an old version of google play services and get these notifications/popups for some apps, however typically the app will work just fine and is complaining for no reason.
I found some other modules like [NoMoreGooglePlayServices](https://github.com/aviraxp/NoMoreGooglePlayServices) and [NoPlayServices](https://github.com/Scrayil/NoPlayServices) that are supposed to disable these popups but I could not get them to work for me so I made my own.
Of course this will only disable the warning/notification and if the app actually requires google play services then it will not work.
